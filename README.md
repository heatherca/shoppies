# The Shoppies
UX Developer Intern &amp; Web Developer Intern Challenge - Winter 2021

## The Project
Hello! Welcome to my Shopify Intern Challenge Submission. Following the project scope I've built an web page that searches the OMDB database and allows users to nominate up to five films for the "Shoppies" awards. I chose to build my project in almost completely Vanilla javascript (minus the API calls). This is a reflection of what I was learning at the time. I had just watched two Wes Bos videos, one on a galley that had a pop up modal and a shopping list that utilized local storage. Since I had never used local storage with javascript in any of my own projects I wanted to see if I was able to apply what I learned towards this challenge. I had also already built a React app involving an API calls called [Where can I see?](https://heatherca.github.io/where-can-I-see/) so I choose to try something new instead. 

## Features
* Searches OMDB database and display only movie results
* Allows user to nominate up to five films, and view nominated films
* User can click or tab and enter on movie posters to learn more about each film and gain access to imdb link for even more info
* Changes nomination button if already nominated and alerts user if they try to click
* Keeps tally of how many nominations user has left and alerts if tries to nominate when list is full
* Allows user to delete films from nomination list
* Saves nomination lists if the user leaves the page
* Responsive up to widths of 320px

## Future Improvements
* Would love to explore the sharable links idea
* Cleaner css and better design overall
* Improved styling on alerts
* A clear all nominees button
